# **A16-FuseBypass: Debug Logic Enabled on Production Apple Silicon**

## Overview

This repository documents a critical hardware-level vulnerability in the Apple A16 Bionic chip used in iPhone 14 Pro Max and related devices. The flaw allows debug logic—meant strictly for development silicon—to be executed on production-fused devices (`dev-fused = 0`) running stock, unmodified iOS with `debug = 0x0`.

No jailbreak. No provisioning profile. No tampering. Just flawed hardware trust enforcement.

## Summary of Findings

* Device: iPhone 14 Pro Max (Apple A16 Bionic)
* Fuse State: `dev-fused = 0` (production)
* Boot Args: `debug = 0x0`
* Expected: Debug logic should be permanently disabled
* Observed: SecureROM, firmware, HAL, and co-processors execute debug routines

---

## Root Cause

A breakdown in fuse enforcement logic and SecureROM privilege gating allows privileged debug pathways to activate despite the production configuration.

This includes:

* SecureROM granting debug privileges
* Firmware injecting debug parameters into co-processors
* HAL subsystems (e.g., AOP, DSP, Haptics) exposing diagnostics
* Multiple SecureROM debug state transitions observed at runtime

---

## Why It Matters

This is a silicon-level trust model failure—not a software bug or configuration oversight.

Implications include:

* Expanded attack surface for silicon introspection and fault injection
* Leakage of privileged telemetry and internal co-processor configuration
* Execution of SecureROM routines typically reserved for development builds
* Potential vectors for exploitation by advanced persistent threats

No assumptions about hardware trust enforcement on Apple Silicon can be considered safe if debug logic can persist in production.

## Steps to Validate

This flaw has been confirmed on multiple unmodified devices running official iOS firmware. To independently validate:

1. Use an iPhone 14 Pro Max with:

   * `dev-fused = 0` (production-fused unit)
   * `debug = 0x0` (stock iOS, unmodified)
2. Boot the device normally
3. Collect logs using:

   * `log show` via macOS Terminal
   * Console.app (on macOS)
   * On-device diagnostics (if accessible)
4. Inspect logs for:

   * `corecaptureIsDebuggable` → debug privilege granted
   * `PRRose::_triggerLogCollection` → unsolicited firmware logging
   * `setConfigParameters: debugLevelParam` → debug params injected into co-processors
   * `aophapticdebug interface active`, `DSP Debug1 enabled` → HAL debug interfaces active

These findings contradict the expected behavior of production-fused hardware and confirm the vulnerability.

## Final Note

The Apple A16 Bionic—widely considered a flagship secure silicon platform—exhibits a persistent, reproducible hardware enforcement failure. This undermines the foundational assumptions of Apple’s hardware trust model and highlights the need for rigorous audit of fuse enforcement mechanisms in all secure SoC designs.
